This was a test to see which of two methods would be best.
When having to dispensers of sauce in a fast-food restaurant, the method of refilling can differ:

1. I wait/work until one of them is empty, then fill both.
2. I wait/work until one of them is nearly empty, then pour the minor amount into the major amount, then fill both.

The sauce is simulated by "atoms", 20 per dispenser (bottle) / "stacks".
They go from bin, to dispenser, to people.
My tests showed that the freshest sauce to people is by first method.
